## Upgrading to 4.3.0

### Documentation guides on upgrades

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade) for documentation on upgrades and [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases)
for release notes of individual releases.

This release series supports upgrades from `4.2.x`.


### New Required Feature Flags

All feature flags introduced in `4.2.0` and earlier are required, including the following:
* `rabbitmq_4.2.0`
* `rabbitmq_4.1.0`
* `rabbitmq_4.0.0`
* `khepri_db`
* `quorum_queue_non_voters`
* `message_containers_deaths_v2`

Enable all required feature flags before upgrading to `4.3.0`.

If your RabbitMQ cluster had plugin `rabbitmq_amqp1_0` enabled in RabbitMQ `3.13.x` (and your cluster still serves AMQP 1.0 client connections in `4.x`), your cluster should do at least one rolling update **after** enabling feature flag `rabbitmq_4.0.0` but **before** upgrading to `4.3.0`.

### Deprecated Features

In `4.3.0` the deprecation phase of the following features advanced from `permitted_by_default` to `denied_by_default`:
* `amqp_filter_set_bug`

### Mixed version cluster compatibility

RabbitMQ 4.3.0 nodes can run alongside `4.2.x`.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended
periods of time (no more than a few hours).

### Recommended Post-upgrade Procedures

This version does not require any additional post-upgrade procedures
compared to other versions.


## Changes Worth Mentioning

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

TBD

### HTTP Auth Backend

#### Enhancements

The HTTP Auth Backend can now optionally provide a custom authorization denial reason to AMQP clients.
To opt in, return `deny <Reason>` (instead of only `deny`) in the HTTP response body of your HTTP auth backend and set the following in your `rabbitmq.conf` file:
```ini
auth_http.authorization_failure_disclosure = true
```

See the [README](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_http/README.md) for more information.
